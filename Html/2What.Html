<p class="indent">The Civil war shaped the United States as we kknow it today.  It had major effects on who we would become.  It was a war fought between the North Sates and the South States.  The American Civil War lasted from April 12, 1861 – May 26, 1865. The war was fought between the north  who were the Union States against and the South, who were the Confederacy States. The main cause of the war was over whether or not if slavery would spread to western territories.  The Union states were much larger and stronger, including New York, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Ohio, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Connecticut, California, Nevada, & Oregon. The Confederate states were Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, North & South Carolina.</p>

<p class="indent">There were 5 Boarder States- that included Delaware, Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, & West Virginia.  These five states were slave states, but they didn’t secede from the Union.  Most border states had strong ties to the South culturally, but they also had strong economic ties to the North. So they stayed part of the Union while still being able to keep slavery.</p>




<p class="indent">In the start of the Civil War, 22 million people lived in the North, while only 9 million lived in the South.  Nearly 4 million of those in the south were slaves, so they really didn’t count. The North had the advantage of more resources and money.  However, the South had a much larger army.  The South found themselves in a tough spot.  The huge armies left crops, livestock & farm animals uncared for or consumed quickly.  In an effort to gather supplies General Lee moved his troops into Pennsylvania in June of 1863.  On July 1st both armies (North & South), met head on in the town of Gettysburg.  The confederates attacked the Union.  By July 3rd General Lee ordered an attack with under 15,000 troops at the center of the Union camp.  The attack failed and many, many lives were lost.  The combined casualties from the two days, was close to 35,000.   It was the highest number of deaths at one time, both sides were devastated.  General Lee was soon forced to withdraw his army on July 4th. The Union had won, stopping General Lee’s invasion, after loosing to Lee at Chancellorsville.  This was a major turning point in the civil war.  Abraham Lincoln, gave his famous Gettysburg address at this time.</p>

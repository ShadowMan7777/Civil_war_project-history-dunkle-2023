  In the North, they were successful with Industry & manufacturing.  They had a few smaller farms, while the South had large-scale farms.  These farms were so big, they depended on slaves to help run them.  The North were very opposed to slavery and the South was angry about this.  Many other factors like the Kansas-Nebraska act and Abraham Lincoln played a part too. </p>
 
 
  <li>The Kansas Nebraska act</li>
  <p class="indent">
  In 1845, the current sitting senator in Illinois brought a bill having some of the greatest impact to legislation in our US history. The bill tried “to organize the Territory of Nebraska,” an area covering the current-day states of Kansas, Nebraska, Montana, and the Dakotas. The Kansas-Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri Compromise & created two new territories.
  During this time, the bill raised the possibility that slavery could be extended into territories where it had once been banned, and pepole were upset on both sides. This produced a violent uprising known as “Bleeding Kansas,” as proslavery (south) and antislavery (north) activists flooded into the territories to sway the votes.</p>

  <li>Abraham lincoln was elected </li>
  <p class="indent">
  Abraham Lincoln, sixteenth President of the United States. Was elected as president on November 6, 1860. Because of this, the Southern states slowly lost their influence and power, and it was the first in the series of events that led to the Civil War. Due to the exclusion of the Southern states from the system, they opted for secession, a decision that led to war.</p>

  <li>The states seceded </li>
  <p class="indent">
  in November 1860 was the final straw, and within three months seven southern states–South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas had seceded from the United States. This led the desperate Confederate States to attack the Union military at Fort Sumter in South Carolina. This lead Aberham Lincoln to officially declare war against the South.</p>
